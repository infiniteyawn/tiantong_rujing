[0134a28] (上堂云)。
Version 2:

.


spirit-spirit, and moment-moment

The dark does not catch the moon that follows the flowing river.

Experience-experience, and residing-residing

The torrent does not catch the rain by pursuing the marching clouds.

.

When all is said and done, how is it?

The sage has no (thought of) self, there is nowhere not already complete.

.


(speaking for eternity:) 

All over the ten directions is mind,

Not-residing everywhere.


And as for the audience?


[Meanwhile:]

The NanYue Mountain range's head separates-divides the clouds,

From the peak of tiantai mountain, the pitter-patter of rain seeps down.



========================================================================== Translator's notes

A rainy day in the tiantong mountains. 

Jing uses a lot of double-repetition of characters, which gives me the feeling of dripping rain viz from the last lines.

the first and third lines "spirit spirit & moment moment", "witness witness & reside reside" are a mystery to me.

Just know that verbs, nouns, plurals, adverbs are all mu in chinese - you could just as easily say divine spirit or witnessing experience.

We also have that interspersed by the moon on flowing water, and the torrent not chasing the rain clouds.

It seems the lines could also run on, although it's not as poetic to say:

"The spirit is divine and often obscured it doesn't obtain the moon that follows the flowing water"

.

Ignore the sages and the mind section, that's pretty dull zen fodder, because we have more double-repetition for the summary in the meantime:

(lit)

Nanyue-summit-head cloud divide-divide (or slice-slice)

Tiantai-peak-below rain drip-drip (modern seep-seep)

(or)

Nanyue-summit top-cloud divide-divide

Tiantai-peak falling-rain drip-drip 


To me (and perhaps because these last sentences were simple and descriptive) this is the most relatable part and a perfect summary.

The struggles of spirit, mind, time and residing. Meanwhile, mountain-mountain cloud-cloud drip-drip river-river.

It seems like Jing was a true man of the rainy Chinese mountains. Not one for longevity though, as he rejoined the mountain soil in 1228 a year after dogen went back to Japan. He's buried there in tiantong (which is roughly where he was born) and it still rains on him a lot to this day as apparently his grave is still up there.
