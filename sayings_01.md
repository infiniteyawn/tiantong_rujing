[0134a28] (上堂云)。
Version 1:




Alert & quick, and at all times [!] 

In darkness, you must not let the moon follow the flow of the river.

Experience experience, and in all respects [!]

When drifting along, you must not let the rain go chasing the clounds.

When all is said and done, regard life as insignificant 

The sage, within no-self, is inexhaustible 




(speaking a long while / speaking for eternity:) 

All over the ten directions is mind

Not-present at every point, it can still be tiny and insignificant .





[Meanwhile:]

The head of the NanYue (Mt. Heng) Mountain range slices up the clouds,

And on the peak of tiantai mountain, the pitter-patter of rain seeps down.
