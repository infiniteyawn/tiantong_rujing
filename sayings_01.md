[0134a28] (上堂云)。
Version 1:

.


Alert & quick, and at all times [!] 

The dark does not catch the moon following the flowing river.

Experience experience, and in all respects [!]

A torrent does not catch the rain in pursuing the marching clouds.

When all is said and done, how is it?

The sage has no (thought of) self, there is no location not already complete.

.


(speaking for eternity:) 

All over the ten directions is mind

Not at one cut's location.


. And as for the audience?


[Meanwhile:]

The head of the NanYue (Mt. Heng) Mountain range slices up the clouds,

And on the peak of tiantai mountain, the pitter-patter of rain seeps down.
