"Is" isn't "is". A ray of light rolls out a sheet of white silk.

"Isn't" isn't "isn't". Flowers and mountaintops in layered brocade.

After all is done, what matter is the edge to the finished composition.

Three realms, there's no technique for it. How can you go looking for where your mind is at? Just sit.

==================================================================
Translator's notes.

I'm getting the feeling Jing was a big fan of fancy fabrics. which is interesting, because he never wore robes appropriate for his station.
Clearly he still has the mountains on his mind too. 
He's saying to you, Flowers and mountaintops are his fancy silk robes.
Following from the last saying it seems the clouds have cleared up a little, at least a ray of light sneaks through.
Quick, it is already full of the colours outside your window.

The translation of the two poetic sentences is basically a wild stab in the dark. 

Let's say the translation is "inspired by" Jing.
