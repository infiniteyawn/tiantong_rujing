On the mountain's shoulders are gold embroidered clouds, all rotten by the first day of spring.

In the river is contained a blue moon, dilute compared to its looks at harvest time.

=

this way, and also, this way.
 
Seems to say it's not in the middle

a blue-eyed blonde...

Never mind, it's tough to describe.

Thoughts from a wondering monk:

Where bodidharma's from they speak sanskrit

On chinese soil, we speak chinese.

...


[0134b04] 上堂云。山披錦雲而爛成春意。水含碧月而淡存秋容。恁麼也恁麼。說似曾不中。黃頭并碧眼。消息子難通。(卓拄杖一下云)西天用梵語。此土使唐言。

A warehouse full of rotten grain (rich person diss)

水含碧月而淡存秋容。

The water contains the blue moon, pale and diluted existence by harvest time appearance.

== Poem:

恁麼也恁麼。
this way and also this way. 

說似曾不中。
It seems it wasn't the middle.

黃頭并碧眼。
Yellow head and blue eyes.

消息子難通。
The information is difficult to communicate.


==

(卓拄杖一下云)

(wandering monk rests down the cane, speaks)

西天用梵語。
In The western paradise they use Sanskrit.

此土使唐言。
On Chinese soil, we speak Chinese.

Notes on the capping phrase, it is more literal and causative than I have written. it's lit "this soil causes tang chinese".
