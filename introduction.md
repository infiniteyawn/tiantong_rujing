[天童]遺落錄序

Preface to the Records of Tiantong

[0133b27] 

夫佛祖道實際理地本離言語相。然佛事門中為物垂慈。則雖非有為又非無語。

The Buddhas dao is essentially practical reality. (opinion)
  
inherently/originally apart from speaking of appearances (the appearances of language/words )

xx Thus, the matter of Buddha's gate things are not handed compassion 
  
xx However, not promising and yet not speechless. [有為有守 - ]




[洞山]五位[臨濟]三玄。

DongShan Mountain (note, dong is cave/hole/zero) this is ZM dongshan [洞山良价]
Linji, you may know.

DongShan ;五位; Linji Sanxuan. 
  



共是垂慈心。

?There is always kindness. 
  


聲止啼黃葉。若就語中生實解者。求馬於唐肆待兔於枯株也。

xxThe sound stops crying yellow leaves.

xxIf justThe real interpreter in the language. 

xxSeeking horses in Tang Si and rabbits in dead plants.

introduce the dao of temple from tiantong.


懼洞宗玄學或為語言勝。以惡拳痛棒。陶冶學者。肆口縱談。

something like - "the fear of the dong school of thought may be because of the superior use of language" 

?

to educate the scholar. 

The unrestrained mouth talks freely. 

擺落枝葉。無華滋旨味。如蒼松架壑風雨盤空。

moving to and fro leave behind the branche and leaf. ?

No flower grows with the aim to be fragrant. 

Such as ancient Pines frame the mountainsides, the elements 盤 space/nothingness. 

曹洞正宗為之一變。所謂懼洞宗玄學或為語言勝。等實得!淨公意。

The authenticity of Caodong is a change. ?

So-called fear, Dongzong? ...  may be the victory of language.

It is the same truth of JingGong's idea


抓著其癢處。永平正法眼藏中。有言云。有一般野猫兒。

scratching an itchy place ?!

always calm, upright, the discerning eye is the core of buddhist scripture

there is something to say,

There are ordinary wild cats

言[洞山]高祖有偏正五位。只須知[洞山]高祖有正法眼藏。是亦會!淨公意。懼為語言勝也。

dongshan ancestry is fifth person...

only, it must be kept in mind dongshan ancestry has ...
  
 this is also equivelant to quotation of JingGong's idea ...
 
 fear because language success also.
 
 
 
 

但所謂曹洞正宗。為之一變者不爾。其似變者唯語言跡。而如正宗。冥合[洞山]本旨。莫過於!淨公。

but so-called plaintiff-defendant genuine

because of a multitude of change, this is not thus/you
  
it appears change only language result
  
yet/but such as genuine (orthodox school?)

Implicitly agreeing with the dongshan original purpose
 
nothing can surpass jinggong 
 

譬如言能學柳下惠者不師其跡也。

for example words can teach without a trace of a teacher.
  
!淨公有六會語錄二卷。所謂

JingGong has six quotations in two volumes (?)

so-called: 

建康府清涼 
jiankang manor is refreshing
