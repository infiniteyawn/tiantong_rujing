夫佛祖道實際理地。本離言語相。然佛事門中為物垂慈。則雖非有為又非無語。

The Buddhas dao is essentially practical reality. (opinion)
  
inherently/originally apart from speaking of appearances (the appearances of language/words )

xx Thus, the matter of Buddha's ...門中 ... to serve as an object for handing down compassion 
  
xx However, not promising and yet not speechless. [有為有守 - ]


洞山五位臨濟三玄。共是垂慈心。聲止啼黃葉。若就語中生實解者。求馬於唐肆待兔於枯株也。

DongShan Mountain (note, dong is cave/hole/zero)
Linji, you may know.

DongShan Mountain ;五位; Linji Sanxuan.

xxSeeking horses in Tang Si and rabbits in dead plants.



璨無文之無文印第五卷天地雪屋韶禪師塔銘序中云。嘉定間淨禪師。倡足菴之道于天童。


懼洞宗玄學或為語言勝。以惡拳痛棒。陶冶學者。肆口縱談。擺落枝葉。無華滋旨味。


如蒼松架壑風雨盤空。曹洞正宗為之一變。所謂懼洞宗玄學或為語言勝。等實得淨公意。


抓著其癢處。永平正法眼藏中。有言云。有一般野猫兒。言洞山高祖有偏正五位。


只須知洞山高祖有正法眼藏。是亦會淨公意。懼為語言勝也。但所謂曹洞正宗。


為之一變者不爾。其似變者唯語言跡。而如正宗。冥合洞山本旨。莫過於淨公。


譬如言能學柳下惠者不師其跡也。淨公有六會語錄二卷。所謂建康府清涼。台州瑞巖。臨安府淨慈。


明州瑞巖。再住淨慈。寧波府天童之六會。而侍者文素妙宗唯敬如玉智湖祖日等所編次。


桐柏吏呂瀟作序。靈隱高原泉天衣嘯巖蔚共作跋。淨公小師廣宗。以理宗紹定二年乙丑夏。


所募刻。而永平廣錄第一卷。有天童和尚語錄到上堂云。箇是天童打[跳-兆+孛]跳。


蹈翻東海龍魚驚。乃此二卷錄也。延寶八年庚申之秋。(予)在東武王子峯。挍讎鏤梓至今三十五年。


而偶得見丹州德雲室中所祕。梵清和尚真筆瑞巖遠公所編天童如淨禪師語錄一卷。


但是天童上堂法語二十則而已矣。於其卷末。高祖元和尚。記淨公法嗣六人機緣淨公略傳了云。


日本仁治二年歲。次辛丑二月中旬。瑞巖遠公遙送此錄付吾。蓋仁治二年者。廣宗募刻後十三年也。


而其六會中之天童錄者。祖日侍者所編。而其編中遺落二十則瑞巖搜出編集。寄元和尚者分明也。


而今德雲寺主了山師。南陽寺主大鏡師。捨衣資圖災木。甚是好心可以嘉矣。(予)乃考其顛末。


令其附前刻。併為三卷。前刻有跋云。昔瑞巖遠公。拔取永平廣錄為一卷。作之跋云。得百千之十一。


抑此亦天童之十一歟。想必有廣錄在。只願後賢勤搜羅之。而今二師附此一卷。則實後賢搜羅之一數也。


好事不乏。天必錫類。則正好摩眼待附之附矣。
