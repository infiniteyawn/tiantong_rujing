[天童]遺落錄序

Preface to the Records of Tiantong

[0133b27] 

======================================================

夫佛祖道實際理地本離言語相。然佛事門中為物垂慈。則雖非有為又非無語。

The Buddhas dao is essentially practical reality. (opinion)
  
inherently/originally apart from speaking of appearances (the appearances of language/words )

xx Thus, the matter of Buddha's gate things are not handed compassion 
  
xx However, not promising and yet not speechless. [有為有守 - ]

璨無文之無文印 第五卷 天地雪屋韶 禪師 塔銘序中 云。

TsanWuWen's WuWenYin Volume 5 TianDi XueWuShao ZenMaster TaMing XuZhong speaks.


嘉定 間 淨禪師。倡足菴之道于[天童]。

Emperor JiaDing asked Zen Master Jing.

"Introduce the dao of TianTong temple".


懼洞宗玄學或為語言勝。以惡拳痛棒。陶冶學者。肆口縱談。

something like - "the fear of the dong school of thought may be because of the superior use of language" 

?

to educate the scholar. 

The unrestrained mouth talks freely. 



擺落枝葉。無華滋旨味。如蒼松架壑風雨盤空。

moving to and fro leave behind the branche and leaf. ?

No flower grows with the aim to be fragrant. 

Such as ancient Pines frame the mountainsides, the elements 盤 space/nothingness. 


曹洞正宗為之一變。所謂懼洞宗玄學或為語言勝。等實得!淨公意。

The authenticity of Caodong is a change. ?

"So-called the fear of the dong school of thought may be because of the superior use of language"

It is the same truth of JingGong's idea




抓著其癢處。永平正法眼藏中。有言云。有一般野猫兒。

scratching an itchy place ?!

always calm, upright, the discerning eye is the core of buddhist scripture

there is something to say,

There are ordinary wild cat (i hope the anser is "there's an ordinary wildcat kitten")


言[洞山]高祖有偏正五位。只須知[洞山]高祖有正法眼藏。是亦會!淨公意。懼為語言勝也。

dongshan ancestry is fifth person...

only, it must be kept in mind dongshan lineage has dhamma eye
  
this is also equivelant to quotation of JingGong's idea ...
 
 fear because language success also.
 
 
 
 

但所謂[曹洞]正宗。為之一變者不爾。其似變者唯語言跡。而如正宗。冥合[洞山]本旨。莫過於!淨公。

But so-called CaoDong orthodoxy, because of a multitude of change, is not so.
  
it appears change only language result
  
contrasting the ru orthodox school?

Implicitly agreeing with the dongshan original purpose
 
nothing can surpass jinggong 
 

譬如言能學柳下惠者不師其跡也。

for example words can teach without a trace of a teacher.
  
==========================

!淨公有六會語錄二卷。所謂

JingGong has six quotations in two volumes (?)

so-called: 

建康府清涼 
jiankang manor is refreshing

台州瑞巖 
taizhou auspicious cliff

臨安府淨慈。
[is this a reference to linji and jing?]

{明州}瑞巖。

Mingzhou venerable/auspicious cliff

再住淨慈。
again dwell only compassinate

抑此亦[天童]之十一歟。想必有廣錄在。只願後賢勤搜羅之。而今二師附此一卷。則實後賢搜羅之一數也。
